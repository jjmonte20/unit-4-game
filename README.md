# unit-4-game

Welcome to my readme file for the gem game.

Rules of the game, as written in the webpage.

# Heigh Ho Rules

You are given a random goal point value. To score, you must click the gems.

Each gem has it's own point value, but the values are random.

To win the game, you must find the gem values and make it equal to the goal score.

If you go over the goal value, you lose.

# Website navigation

I put in console logs for the gem values and goal score so that the game can be won by inspecting the values and doing some simple math on the fly.  After the first game if finished, you should get a win/loss console log and a reset of the new goal score, new current value,
and new gem values.

The actual website itself is pretty straightforward.  Just simple text with updatable values for the wins, losses, current value, and goal value.  Can interact with the webpage by clicking the gems.

I hope you enjoy the game, I put a lot of work into it.
